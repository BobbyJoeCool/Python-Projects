# Python Projects

This codespace is for projects out of the Python books that I am attempting to do on my own, outside of class, or attempts at making the assignment harder by adding newer things to it, such as going back and taking older assignments and adding newer elements to it (such as a GUI to command line programs).

Mostly this is an attempt for me to play with coding to fully grasp and understand how Python works, but also to play and have fun with the code itself.
